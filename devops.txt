///////////////////////////////////////////
The commands *git push -u origin main* and *git push origin main* are almost the same, but there's an important difference related to tracking branches:

✅ git push origin main
Pushes the main branch to the origin remote.

Does not set up tracking between your local main and the remote main.

You’ll need to specify the branch every time you push or pull in the future unless tracking is already set.

✅ git push -u origin main
Also pushes the main branch to the origin remote.

The -u (or --set-upstream) sets the upstream (tracking) relationship between your local main branch and origin/main.

After this, you can simply use:


git push
git pull
